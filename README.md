<h2 align="center">Nerf skeletons once and for all!</h2>

The Stormtrooper plugin nerfs, or weakens, the Minecraft skeleton's aimbot. Stormtroopers, from the Star Wars series, are known to have bad aim. Now, byteful has finally merged the Stormtrooper into the Minecraft skeleton and has provided the community with the much needed plugin.

### Features:
- Configurable accuracy
- Ability to give skeletons and players "Stormtrooper" aim.
- Absolutely no impact to server performance.
- Make your players happy.
